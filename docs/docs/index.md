# VkLite – Modern Vulkan Renderer

Welcome to **VkLite** – a lightweight, modern Vulkan renderer built from the ground up for educational purposes. This comprehensive tutorial series will guide you through creating a ready-to-use graphics engine using modern Vulkan techniques and C++. The project itself is compiled using C++20 standard, but minimal modern C++ features have been used for ease of learning and replicability using other languages. 

## Target Audience

## Concepts you will learn

By the end of this series, you'll have created a fully functional Vulkan renderer capable of:
