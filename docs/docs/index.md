# VkLite – A Modern Vulkan Renderer

**VkLite** is a lightweight yet fully functional Vulkan-based renderer developed from first principles. It serves as both a practical implementation and a pedagogical guide for building a modern real-time graphics engine. While the material is approachable for beginners, it is also structured to scale with intermediate-level learners who wish to develop a deeper understanding of graphics programming using Vulkan and C++.

The renderer is written using the C++20 standard, but modern language features have been deliberately limited to ensure clarity, portability, and accessibility. The codebase is organized with clean abstractions and modular architecture, making it suitable as a starting point for research projects, educational tools, or real-time games.

## Target Audience

This material is designed for:

- Undergraduate and graduate students studying computer graphics or game development.
- Beginners with a strong interest in graphics programming who are willing to engage with low-level APIs.
- Intermediate developers familiar with OpenGL, DirectX, or Metal seeking a transition into Vulkan.
- Researchers and hobbyists building custom engines or interactive simulation environments.

A prior understanding of basic C++ programming and linear algebra is expected. No prior Vulkan experience is required.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this material, the reader will be able to:

- Initialize and manage Vulkan instances, devices, and swapchains.
- Understand and implement GPU-side synchronization, memory barriers, and descriptor sets.
- Construct a fully functional render loop suitable for real-time applications.
- Design and compile compute and graphics pipelines.
- Integrate runtime tooling using Dear ImGui.
- Manage GPU resources and memory efficiently.
- Build a minimal scene graph with spatial transforms and camera systems.
- Load and sample images and construct a material abstraction layer.
- Implement a basic physically based rendering (PBR) system using real-time lighting models.

These outcomes are intended to not only teach Vulkan usage but also provide foundational knowledge for engine architecture and GPU programming practices.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, readers should ensure the following requirements are met:

- A system with a Vulkan-compatible GPU and up-to-date drivers.
- A C++20-compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- Development tools: Git, CMake, and a code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Visual Studio).
- Familiarity with:
    - Programming fundamentals in C++
    - Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, coordinate systems)
    - Compilation and linking workflows in modern C++

No prior graphics API experience (e.g., OpenGL or DirectX) is required but will be helpful.

## Structure of the Course

The material is organized into progressive chapters. Each chapter builds upon concepts introduced previously and concludes with practical implementations in code. The structure is as follows:

- **Introduction to Vulkan**  
  Overview of the Vulkan API, its design philosophy, and how it differs from older graphics APIs.

- **Project Setup**  
  Preparing the build system using CMake, acquiring dependencies, and establishing a development environment.

- **Render Loop**  
  Constructing the per-frame rendering process using Vulkan command buffers, semaphores, and fences.

- **Compute Pipeline**  
  Implementing compute shaders for tasks such as simulation, post-processing, and general GPU compute.

- **ImGui Integration**  
  Embedding Dear ImGui for runtime UI tools, debug panels, and in-engine inspectors.

- **GPU Memory Management**  
  Exploring allocation strategies and abstraction layers for efficient buffer and image memory usage.

- **Graphics Pipeline**  
  Creating programmable graphics pipelines with support for dynamic states, shader modules, and vertex input.

- **Scene Graph, Transforms, and Camera**  
  Developing a hierarchical object system with support for spatial transforms and multiple camera views.

- **Textures and Materials**  
  Loading texture data from files, sampling in shaders, and associating textures with material parameters.

- **Physically Based Rendering**  
  Implementing PBR with support for metal/roughness workflows and real-time lighting.
